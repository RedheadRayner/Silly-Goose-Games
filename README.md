# Silly Goose Games


Welcome to my self-created game software. This code is intended to be uploaded to my personal PCB [Silly Goose](https://github.com/RedheadRayner/Silly-Goose).

## Tetris

## Features

The current master branch is able to:
- Have basic tetris gameplay rules as featured on the first tetris debut.
- A basic menu for navigation of scores, gameplay and settings.
- Save scores between power cycles with custom 8 character names.
- Display two types of scoring- general scoring and 'personal best' (where the latter will only display one score per unique name).


## Outstanding features

The following features are outstanding and I will be adding them in future:
- Super rotation rules (rotating and 'bouncing' off of the boundaries).
- Audio
